# Unsupported Apps Detection Script
  
**Scripts**  
   
Invoke-UnsupportedAppToast.ps1  
 
**SYNOPSIS** 
  
Pop a toast notification if unsupported applications are detected  
  
**DESCRIPTION**  
  
This script is designed to be run as a Proactive Remediation. 
The BadApps array contains application names that are considered unsupported by the company. The user is prompted to remove the application(s).
If no BadApps are found, the output of the script is "No Bad Apps Found" and no Toast is displayed. If BadApps are found, along with the Toast notification, the BadApps are written to the script output as a JSON which is viewable in Proactive Remediation Device Results.  
  
Each App in the $BadApps Array is compared using the -like *$BadApps* operator against each App found on the device. If a match is found, the app is added to another Array called $BadAppArray.  
  
*Note: The script is suitable for environments where users have the correct permissions to remove the application(s) listed.*
  
There is no Remediation Script. The user is alerted, by a Toast Notification via the Detection script. If unsupported apps are found, the list of Apps, version and publisher are output as a compressed JSON and viewable in the Results column in Endpoint Analaytics.  
  
**Variables**  
  
Several Variables are configurable to customise the toast notification:-  
  
**$BadApps** = an Array that contains the list of unsupported apps.  
**$GoodMorning** = "Good Morning" - Use Regional Language alternative if English is not the first language  e.g. "God Morgen"
